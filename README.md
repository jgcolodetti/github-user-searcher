### About
Project developed with ReactJs and [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps#users). Users can search for anyone registered on GitHub by their username. The page shows meta information about the searched user, as well as some of the most recent respositories they worked on. The history page shows all usernames the user has searched for, sorted by timestamp, and every item in the history is clickable, so the app searches the term again and go to the home page. The app uses localStorage to store the history so it doesn't reset after a page reload, so there is a button that clears the history for the user if he wishes.
